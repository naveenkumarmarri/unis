* UNIS Implementation Notes
Below are a few temporary notes on the implementation of new features
for the unis runtime.

** PubSub
*** Implementation
The pubsub mechanism in unis taps into a Redis server in order to
track channel based subscriptions from clients.  These subscriptions
run through a RESTful API and are independant of implementation details
on either the client or server.

*** API
The RESTful API for subscribing to messages from UNIS or the MS follows
the structure of the non-subscription based API calls.  Any resource with
a schema may be subscribed to by using the schema name as the =--reference=,
specific resources can be subscribed to using a =--reference= and an =--id=.

| Action    | Noun             | Example                | Description                                     |
|-----------+------------------+------------------------+-------------------------------------------------|
| subscribe | /{resource}      | ws://localhost/port    | Subscribes to all resources of a given schema   |
| subscribe | /{resource}/{id} | ws://localhost/node/25 | Subscribes to a single resource with a given id |
