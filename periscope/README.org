* UNIS PubSub Implementation
Below are installation instructions and notes on the publisher/subscriber implementation for the UNIS runtime.

** PubSub

*** Dependencies
Redis is used to implement the publisher subscriber pattern
#+BEGIN_SRC
$ sudo yum install redis
$ sudo redis-server&
#+END_SRC

The tornado-redis module allows UNIS to communicate with redis
#+BEGIN_SRC
$ sudo easy_install pip
$ sudo pip install tornado-redis
#+END_SRC

*** Install
Run the setup script in top level of the repository.
#+BEGIN_SRC
$ sudo python setup.py build
$ sudo python setup.py install
#+END_SRC

*** Run
You can run UNIS as a daemon
#+BEGIN_SRC
$ sudo periscoped
#+END_SRC

or run UNIS straight from the repository
#+BEGIN_SRC
$ sudo python periscope/app.py
#+END_SRC

Either of which will start UNIS running on port 8888.

*** Implementation
The pubsub mechanism in UNIS taps into a Redis server in order to
track channel based subscriptions from clients.  These subscriptions
run through a RESTful API and are independent of implementation details
on either the client or server.

*** API
The RESTful API for subscribing to messages from UNIS or the MS follows
the structure of the non-subscription based API calls.  Any resource with
a schema may be subscribed to by using the schema name as the =reference=,
specific resources can be subscribed to using a =reference= and an =id=.

|-----------+------------------+------------------------+-------------------------------------------------|
| subscribe | /{resource}      | ws://localhost/port    | Subscribes to all resources of a given schema   |
| subscribe | /{resource}/{id} | ws://localhost/node/25 | Subscribes to a single resource with a given id |
