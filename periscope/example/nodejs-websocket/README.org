* Node.js Implementation of PubSub with UNIS
Included in this directory is an example of a nodejs connection to the
UNIS and MS pubsub mechanism.  This example requires the =ws= module
installed.

#+BEGIN_SRC
$ sudo npm install ws
#+END_SRC

** Usage
Start up the server.
#+BEGIN_SRC
$ node node_server.js
#+END_SRC

Now navigate to =http://localhost:8080= on a web browser.  Back in 
the terminal, push data into the UNIS server either by using =--curl=
or by using the included testing script
#+BEGIN_SRC
$ sudo python test_pubsub.py
#+END_SRC

If all goes well, there will be a message appearing on the webpage for
each =measurement= resource added to UNIS.
